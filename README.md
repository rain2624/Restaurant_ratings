# Restaurant_ratings
This project is related to the Restaurant Ratings data (in Mexico) from Maven analytics.
The project is divided in two parts.                              
  1. Data Cleaning and Answering queries using - SQL.                
  2. Data Visualization using - powerbi.                           
The aim of this project was to understand the following:                    
  1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?         
  2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?           
  3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?         
  4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?
